	\chapter{Pre-requisite}
	This chapter covers topics of Abstact Algebra and Number Theory that are required for cryprography and elliptic curves. This chapters starts with the defination of Group, Ring, Field.
	\section{Group}
	The set  $G$ is equipped with  single operation $*$ such the the $4$ below properties are satisfied is called a Group.\\
	$(1)$ Closure: $\forall x,y \in G, x*y \in G$ \\
	$(2)$ Additive identity: $\exists 0 \in G$, such that $ \forall x \in G$, $ 0*x=x*0=x$\\
	$(3)$ Associative Property: $ \forall x,y,z \in G$, $(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)$ \\
	$(4)$ Inverse: $ \forall x \in S, \exists y \in G$ such that$x*y=0$ where $y$ is known as inverse of $x$ and is denoted by $x^{-1}$
	\subsection{Abelian Group}
	The set $G$ is equipped with  single operation $*$ such the the $5$ below properties are satisfied is called a Abelian Group.\\
	$(1)$ Closure: $\forall x,y \in G, x*y \in G$ \\
	$(2)$ Additive identity: $\exists 0 \in G$, such that $ \forall x \in G$, $ 0*x=x*0=x$\\
	$(3)$ Associative Property: $ \forall x,y,z \in G$, $(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)$ \\
	$(4)$ Commutatitve Property: $ \forall x,y \in G$, $x*y=y*x$ \\
	$(5)$ Inverse: $ \forall x \in G, \exists y \in G$ such that $x*y=0$ where $y$ is known as inverse of $x$ and is denoted by $x^{-1}$	
	
	So, a abelian group G is a group with $\forall x,y \in G, x*y=y*x$

	\section{Ring}
	A ring is a set $R$ with two operations $+$ and $*$ which satisfy the below properties\\
	$(1)$ It is abelian group under $+$ \\
	$(2)$ Closure under $*$:  $x,y \in R \Rightarrow	x*y \in R $  \\
	$(3)$ Associative under $*$: $x,y,z \in R \Rightarrow	(x*y)*z=x*(y*z) $\\
	$(4)$ Distributive property $x,y,z \in R$
	$$x*(y+z)=x*y+x*z$$ $$(x+y)*z=x*z+y*z$$
	
	\section{Field}
	A Field is a set $F$ with two operations $+$ and $*$ with following properties \\
	$(1)$Commutative group under $+$\\
	$(2)$Commutative group under $*$\\
	$(3)$Distributive property $x,y,z \in F$
	$$x*(y+z)=x*y+x*z$$ $$(x+y)*z=x*z+y*z$$\\

	\subsection{Symmetric ciphers}
	Let Alice want to share a message m with Bob. They do so by using a common key and knowledge of some algorithm to encrypt and decrypt message. Alice encrypts the message using the key to produce the cipher text. Now Bob can use key with cipher text to decrypt message.
